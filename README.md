# ComplexBTree
To run this program, pull all files to your local machine. Then run the following command

./a.out 

In this program I am demonstarting key concepts learned in C++. Here, I use operator overloading in an object oriented program, while tackling the difficult concept of balanced 2-3 trees. I implement an insert, removal, and display using a 2-3 data structure. I also utilize inheritance and derived classes to allow for abstraction and to test the concepts I learned at PSU.
